After you have installed the extension, you get a new menu item 'Mailbox
Alert' if you right-click on a folder in your folder pane. This option opens
a small preferences screen that allows you to specify a system command that
will be executed if Thunderbird notices that there is new mail there.

You can use a few macros that will be substituted by appropriate values:

* '''%server'''
     The name of the server where the mail folder resides
* '''%folder'''
     The name of the mail folder
* '''%count'''
     The number of unread messages
* '''%sender'''
     The sender of the last unread message
* '''%subject'''
     The subject of the last unread message
* '''%charset'''
     The character set of the folder

Be sure to escape arguments if they contain spaces. Spaces are read as
argument separators so for instance, if you want the string "My Mail" to be
1 argument, the space in that string must have a \ in front of it.

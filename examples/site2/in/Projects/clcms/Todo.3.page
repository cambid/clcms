The todo list contains at least the following things. It is not really a
versioned roadmap since this list resides mostly in my head and changes by
the minute.

The most important things are (in random order):

* '''Error detection and feedback'''

     There's still a lot to improve on error handling i guess.

* '''Code cleanup'''

     The everlasting todo.

* '''Command line options'''

     Verbosity, 'check run', option overrides, etc.

* '''Documentation'''

     The other everlasting todo.

* '''File date checks'''

     clcms does check to see if pages need to be recreated, but only outputs
     them if this is so, they are always internally built. Also, updates
     from .inc and .macro files are not taken into account. I'll have to
     think up some dependency system for this.

* '''Page types'''

     I'd like to add some form of page types, i.e. 'blog style' or 'FAQ' or
     something like that.

* '''File modified date'''

     The file modified could maybe use some sort of memory, copying them
     without keeping the original modified dates can often lead to an
     unexpected page item order.

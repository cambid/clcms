Welcome to my DNSSEC test page. You can verify if you have a working DNSSEC
setup here. You may have arrived here through different hostnames but the
important two are these:

[[http://www.jelte.nlnetlabs.nl/Projects/DNSSEC/index.html][www.jelte.nlnetlabs.nl]]

[[http://bogussig.test.jelte.nlnetlabs.nl/Projects/DNSSEC/index.html][bogussig.test.jelte.nlnetlabs.nl]]

on most systems, both these links should work, but if you use
[[http://www.dnssec.net/][DNSSEC]] with [jelte.]nlnetlabs.nl as
dnssec-must-be-secure, and
[[Kjelte.nlnetlabs.nl.+005+42860.key][this key]] as a trusted key, the first one should work, but the second should
not.

if you use the NLnetLabs [[http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/dnssec/drill_extension.html][DNSSEC firefox extension]]
with that key, the icon should appear green on the first link and red on the second.

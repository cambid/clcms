This extension for Firefox provides a way to add typable tags to hyperlinks
on webpages. This can be useful for instance in forum pages where a lot of
links have the same name, or links that only have images and no text.
Installing the plugin should turn on accessibility.typeaheadfind and
accessibility.typeaheadfind.linksonly. If it doesn't, or you want to turn it
off again, go to about:config. You can then also use / to start a
search. [[Linktag/index.html][Linktag page]].

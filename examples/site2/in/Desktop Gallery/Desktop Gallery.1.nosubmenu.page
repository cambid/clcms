About every few months I get bored with my desktop setup and I go on a scavenger hunt for a new window manager. A while ago I thought it might be nice to keep screenshots of my old setups, and though I have misplaced quite a few of them, some have magically lived through my other passion (formatting my disks and trying new operating systems).

I should have some more on derelict disks that are gathering dust somewhere around here, so there may be more coming up sooner or later.

So for anyone that's interested, here are some of the desktops that I have enjoyed the past years.

Ow since i keep changing so much, the comments for eacht screenshot will always be out of date, and I do not update them :p

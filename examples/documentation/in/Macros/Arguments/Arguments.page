If you want to pass arguments to your macro, you can do that by calling it with
_<<name>>_<<arg1>>_<<arg2>>_<<etc>>_

You can use parentheses () around each argument if it contains any
characters not in [a-zA-Z0-9]: _<<name>>_(a b _d fg)_ will evaluate in the
macro <<name>> with 1 argument "a b _d fg".

In the .macro file, these arguments are passed as the list called arguments.
The first argument can be retrieved with arguments[0] and so on. Be careful
not to pass too few values, for it will result in an error and stack dump.
It is prudent to check the arguments array in your macro's.

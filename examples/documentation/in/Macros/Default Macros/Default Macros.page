There are a number of builtin macros in clcms. These can be overridden by specifying your own macro with the same name.

* '''menu'''
     (2 integer arguments)
     Will be replaced with the main menu, with the argument as is depth
     (depth as in how many subdirectories it will check for subitems). The
     menuitemX macros below are then used for each level of menu. The second
     argument specifies the 'start depth'. So if you use _2_1_ as arguments,
     only the second level is shown, with the current page or one of it's
     (grand)parent as indicator.

* '''submenu'''
     Will be replaced with the submenu, the list of page items within one
     page.

* '''nextpage'''
     Will be replaced by a link to the next page in the directory tree.

* '''prevpage'''
     Will be replaced by a link to the previous page in the directory tree.

* '''uppage'''
     Will be replaced by a link to the parent page in the directory tree.

* '''title'''
     Will be replaced by the title of the current page.

* '''stylesheet'''
     Will be replaced by the text 'default.css'.

* '''date'''
     Will be replaced by the date (YYYY-mm-dd) when clcms is run.

* '''datefile'''
     Will be replaced by the last modified date (YYYY-mm-dd) of the most
     recent one of the .page files.

* '''itemseparator'''
     Will be placed between page items. By default it's a small horizontal
     line.

* '''submenuitemseparator'''
     Will be placed between submenu items. By default it's a small horizontal
     line.

* '''header'''
     Will be used in at the start of every page. Redefine this with you own header.inc

* '''footer'''
     Will be used in at the end of every page. Redefine this with you own footer.inc

* '''menustart'''
     Will be used at the start of the "menu" macro.

* '''menuend'''
     Will be used at the end of the "menu" macro.

* '''menuitemXstart'''
     Will be used at the start of a menu item in the top level.

     X is an integer specifying the page depth for the menu item (for
     instance, for the first level, you can override menuitem1start)

     This can be overridden in 2 ways: for a simple .inc, you can override
     it by defining the macro menuitem1start, which will be evaluated, and
     followed by the name of the page (in a link if appropriate). Or you can
     override menuitem1start-arg, which takes the name of the page as it's
     first (and only!) argument. See examples/site2 for an example of this.

* '''menuitemXend'''
     Will be used at the end of a menu item in the top level.

     X is an integer specifying the page depth for the menu item

* '''menuitemXselected'''
     Will be added to the <<a>> tag of the menu entry for the current page ant
     it's (grand)parents. You can override this with the value
     'class="selected"' for instance.

   If you want deeper menus, you must define menuitemXstart/end for each
   extra level.

* '''debug'''
     (1 string argument)
     Will print the given string to stdout while creating the page. Does
     nothing else.

* '''dumpmacros'''
     Will print the list of all current macros and their sources to stdout.

* '''fake'''
     Does nothing.


There are also a few built-in macros that cannot be overridden:

* '''NO_WIKI'''
     Will cause the next lines
     .not.
     to be passed through the wiki engine

* '''NO_WIKI_END'''
     Marks the end of the NO_WIKI part.

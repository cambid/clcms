* Content is stored in a directory tree
* Adding pages (or items?) should be as easy as creating a new file
     and typing some lines in it.
* For default pages/items no config necessary, i.e. no editing files
     other than the page file itself to get it added to the system, etc.
* No HTML or anything alike for normal usage (after creating initial headers etc.)
* All pages (can) have their binary content (images, download files) in
     the directory of the page itself
* All output is static, no generating on the fly

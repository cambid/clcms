Let's say we want to create 3 pages: a news page, an about page, and a Link page.

We also want a standard menu, but no fancy layout for now.

We do want these pages in a fixed order, so we have to specify the sort
order in their names. These options will not be copied in the output file
names.

So, let's create the containers for those pages, shall we?

=mkdir News.1=
=mkdir About.2=
=mkdir Links.3=

Since we have no news yet, let's start with the About page.

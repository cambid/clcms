By default, clcms will read the directory in/ for the content tree, and
store the results in the directory out/. This can be overridden with a
.setup file in the directory you run it from, see
[[../../Content_Tree/File_Types/index.html][File Types]] for more on this.

A typical directory tree would look a little like this small example:

   * in/
      * my_site.setup
      * header.inc
      * footer.inc
      * Welcome.1/
         * welcome.page
      * News.2/
         * new\ site.page
         * going\ to\ move.page
         * added\ pages.page
      * Contact.3/
         * Address.page
         * Info.page

The output filename for a page directory (in the out/ directory) will be the same as
input directory name, except that spaces will be replaced by underscores (_)

Keep this in mind when making hard internal links (which you shouldn't. Use
id's.).

All .page files for each page will become a part of the index.html for that
page. Their title in the page is their name up to the first dot. The same
goes for their HTML anchor, except that spaces are replaced by '_'.

The names of copied files are kept intact.

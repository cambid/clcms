attr: id Content Attributes.page
attr: date 2006-03-20 20:15:53
attr: sort order 3


For .page files, you can specify some options with attribute lines:
__attr: <<attribute name>> <<optional attirbute value>>

For instance:
__attr: sort order 4

Attribute lines are only parsed if they are the first lines of the .page
file, and must begin with "attr: " (case insensitive). Once a line has been
seen that does not start with "attr: ", clcms will stop looking for
attribute lines.

Attribute names and values are case insensitive.

The complete list of attributes is:

* '''id'''

     This is the id of the content item. At the moment this is not used.
     Future versions can use this in links, much the same as ids of
     page.attr files. If no id is specified, clcms will add it for you.

* '''date <<date>>'''

     This attribute specifies the date of creation of this file. This is
     used in sorting, and can be shown like the title of this content item
     by setting showtitledate to true.  The date format can be specified in
     the .setup options, and defaults to "YYYY-MM-DD". If this attribute is
     not specified, clcms will add it for you. If you want to regenerate it
     later, just remove this line.

* '''showtitle <<true/false>>'''

     Specifies if this part will be preceded by its title (i.e. the filename without the extension).

* '''showtitledate <<true/false>>'''

     Specifies if this part will be preceded by its set date.

* '''wiki <<true/false>>'''

     Specifies if part will be put through the wiki engine.

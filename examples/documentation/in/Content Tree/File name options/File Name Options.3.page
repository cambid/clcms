For .page files, you can specify some options through file extensions. You
can specify multiple extensions per file (separated by the '.' character,
but this can be overridden. The last extension must be .page. Otherwise, the
order of the extensions is free.

The complete list of options is:

   * *nomenu*

     This part will not be put in the submenu (if you have a submenu on the page).

   * *notitle*

     This part will not be preceded by its filename title.

   * *title*

     This part
     .will.
     be preceded by its filename title.

   * *nowiki*

     This part will not be put through the wiki engine.

   * *wiki*

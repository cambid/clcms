For .page files, if one of the extension options is an integer, it will be
interpreted as the sorting order. If files have no or equal sort orders,
they are sorted by their last modified date (last modified = first in list).
That way, new items in, for example, a news page will be added to the top of
the page. If a sort order is specified for an item, this item will always
come before those without a sort order.

For pages, you can specify the sort order is by putting it into the
page.meta file, see [[:file_types][]] for more information on the page.meta
file.

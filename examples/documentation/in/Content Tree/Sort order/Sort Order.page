attr: id Sort Order.page
attr: date 2006-02-13 20:18:28

For .page files, you can specify the sorting order as an attribute. If files
have no or equal sort orders, they are sorted by their date attribute (later
date = earlier in list). If they have no date attribute yet it is derived
from the last modified date of the file.

That way, new items in, for example, a news page will be added to the top of
the page. If a sort order is specified for an item, this item will always
come before those without a sort order.

For pages, you can specify the sort order is by putting it into the
page.attr file, see [[:file_types][]] for more information on the page.attr
file.

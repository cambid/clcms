By default, your .page files will be run through the wiki engine. This way
you shouldn't have to write any html yourself for normal pages. If you find
that you are using _NO_WIKI_ a lot, you might want to think about creating
some macros. Or mail me about feature requests. Patches help.

The wiki engine will handle each line and transform some of the
constructions to it's html counterpart:

   * *paragraph*

     An empty line will signify a new paragraph.

   * *bold*

     If a line starts and ends with a *, the line will be put in bold font.

   * *italics*

     If a line starts and ends with a ., the line will be put in italic font.

   * *monospaced*

     If a line starts and ends with a =, the line will be put in monospaced font.

   * *links*

     Links should be entered in the form [_fake_[<URL>][<name>]]


     You can use an optional third entry between [] to specify a piece of
     text that will be copied directly into the <a> tag of the HTML, for
     instance, if you use [_fake_[URL][name][class="big_link"]], the
     resulting HTML will be:
     =<a href="URL" class="big_link"><name></a>=
   * *images*

     Images should be entered in the form {_fake_{<URL>}{<name>}}


     You can use an optional third entry between {} to specify a piece of
     text that will be copied directly into the <a> tag of the HTML, for
     instance, if you use

     [_fake_[URL][name][class="gImage" width="100px"]], the
     resulting HTML will be:
     =<img src="URL" alt="name" class="gImage" width="100px" />=
   * *bullet list*

     You can create a bullet list by placing 3 spaces, one *, and another
     space at the start of the line. The rest of the line will be handled as
     a complete line (for bold font properties etc.).

     If you are 'inside' a bullet list, empty lines will only signify a <br />
     
     You can nest bullet lists by using 6 or 9 spaces for level 2 or 3
     bullets.

URLs are either absolute (i.e. beginning with http://) or relative from the
current output directory, so for an image that is in the same directory as
the .page file, you can just put in the image file name.

Parts between the lines containing "_NO_WIKI_" and "_NO_WIKI_END_" are not
handled at all.

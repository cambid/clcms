clcms makes a distinction between files based on two things: whether they
are a file or a directory, and what their extension is. The default
extension separator is the ., but this can be changed.

There are 4 different file types:

* '''.setup file'''

     A file that ends in .setup contains configuration directives for clcms
     to use. These directives will override the current ones, or be added to
     them. They will only be used in the current directory and the
     subdirectories of the current directory, if they are not overriden
     again. You can see the possible options if you call clcms with the -c
     argument.

* '''.setup directory'''

     A Directory whose name ends in .setup will be scanned for setup, .inc
     .and .macro files. These will be read as if they stood in
     the current directory.

* '''Normal directory'''

     A Directory whose name does not end in .setup will be seen as a page
     container. It either stands for a website page itself (if it has one or
     more .page files), it contains several other pages (if it has page
     directories as children), or both.

* '''.page file'''

     A .page file contains the actual content of a (part of a) page. As the
     directory stands for the page itself, this stands for a part of the
     content.

* '''.inc file'''

     A .inc file will be read and added directly to the macro list. For this
     directory and its subdirectories, you can use _<<filename>>_ (where
     filename is the .inc file name up to the first (!) '.' character. This
     will be replaced by the contents of the .inc file.

* '''.macro file'''

     .macro files work the same way, except that they do not contain plain
     text, but actual Python code. See the section
     [[:macros][]] for more on this.

* '''page.attr'''

     A page.attr file is a text file that contains a few directives for
     clcms regarding the page in whose directory this file was found.
     The file should contain lines of the form "<<name>>: <<value>>"
     Currently, there are two options:
** id:
        This is the id of the page, you can refer to this page in links with
        the colon. See the Links section in [[:wiki_markup][]] for more on
        this.
** sort order:
        This is the sort order of the page, with this you can influence the
        order in which pages are shown on your site.
** nomenu:
	This page will not be added to the menu.
** nosubmenu:
	This page will not contain a submenu with anchors to .content files.

* All other files are seen as content data and are directly copied to the
     output directory of the current page.

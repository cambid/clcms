A macro definition is just one or more lines of python code, that, after
running, should have put the replacement string for the macro in the
variable called "output".

You have the following variables to read out from within your macro:

   * *options*

     The global variable containing .setup file options. You can read these out with
      * *get_option(options, "option_name")*
        for single options
      * *get_options(options, "option_name")*
        for plural options (ie. lists)
      * *get_option_dir(options, "option_name")*
        for options that contain files or directories. These will be made
        absolute (for the system you run clcms on, not for the website) if
        they do not start with a /

   * *page_name*

     Contains the title of the current page.

   * *root_dir*

     Contains the location of the root directory on the filesystem

   * *in_dir*

     Contains the location of the content input directory

   * *cur_dir_depth*

     The current page (directory) depth.

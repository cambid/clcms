clcms provides you with the following default macros:

   * *MENU*
     This will be replaced by the menu div. Be careful, there should at most only one menu item on each page.
   * *TITLE*
     This will be replaced by the current page title (ie. the base name of the directory the page content is in)
   * *STYLESHEET*
     This will be replaced by the location of the style sheet, specified in your .setup (<content_dir>/default.css by default)
   * *DATE*
     This will be replaced by the date you ran clcms.py on (format "YYYY-mm-dd").
   * *DATEFILE*
     This will be replaced by the last-modified date of the current input file or directory (format "YYYY-mm-dd")

You can override any of these by placing a <macro-name>.macro file in the directory.

There are a few "macros" that cannot be overridden:

   * *NO_WIKI*
     This will tell the wiki engine that the next lines should be copied and not parsed
   * *NO_WIKI_END*
     This will tell the wiki engine that the next lines should be parsed again

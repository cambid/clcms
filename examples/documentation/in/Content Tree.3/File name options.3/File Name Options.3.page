Apart from specifying the file type with an optional extension, you can also
pass some options through extensions. You can specify multiple extensions
per file (separated by the '.' character, but this can be overridden. The
last extension must be the file type, and if you specify a 
[[Sort_order][sort order]], it
must be the first. Otherwise, the order of the extensions is free.

The complete list of options is:

   * For .page files:
      * *nomenu*

        This part will not be put in the submenu (if you have a submenu on the page).

      * *notitle*

        This part will not be preceded by its filename title.

      * *title*

        This part
        .will.
        be preceded by its filename title.

      * *nowiki*

        This part will not be put through the wiki engine.

      * *wiki*
        This part
        .will.
        be put through the wiki engine.

   * For directories:
      * *nomenu*
        This page will not be put in the main menu.

      * *stop*
        clcms will copy the directory, if it does not exists in the
        deployment tree, but will stop after that, and not mess with any
        data that is already present there.

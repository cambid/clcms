The output filename for a page directory (in the out/ directory) will differ
from the input file name:

   * Extensions will be stripped from it.
   * Spaces will be replaced by underscores (_)

Keep this in mind when making hard internal links.

All .page files for each page will become a part of the index.html for that
page.

Copied files names are kept intact.

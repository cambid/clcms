Let's take a quick look at the root directory (i.e. the directory where you
run clcms from).

{{root_dir.png}{root directory}}

You see a few subdirectories and a file ending in .setup. The .setup file
contains directives for clcms to follow.

If clcms encounters a .setup file while walking through the directory tree,
it will follow these new directives in it for the current directory and all
subdirectories of the current directory. The rest of the tree is unaffected.
This is the first way to override settings.

In this case, the .setup file specifies that the content tree is in the
directory in/, that the output should be sent to out/, and some header and
footer files that will be handled by clcms are in inc/.

documentation.setup:

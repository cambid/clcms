You can override some behaviour of clcms by putting .<option> in the file
name. The ordering seen in [[#content_directory][content directory]] is only
one example of this.

The complete list of options is:

   * For all files:
      * *number*

        Sort order of this file. This one is only handled if this is the first option
   * For .page files:
      * *nosubmenu*

        This part will not be put in the submenu

      * *notitle*

        This part will not be preceded by its filename title

      * *title*

        This part
        .will.
        be preceded by its filename title

      * *nowiki*

        This part will not be put through the wiki engine

      * *wiki*

        This part
        .will.
        be put through the wiki engine

   * For directories:
      * *nomenu*
        This page will not be put in the main menu

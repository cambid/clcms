As said in the [[File_Types][File types]] section, you can create .inc files
and .macro files. These will both be usable in your pages as macros.

A macro looks like this: 
=_<name>_=

This will be replaced by the contents of the <name>.inc in the current
directory scope, or by the value you have put in the output variable in the
<name>.macro file in the current directory scope.

Some macros can have arguments:
=_<name>_<arg1>_<arg2>_=

Passing too few arguments, or bad ones can result in some nasty errors, so
watch out for this. Passing too much arguments has no result.

An example of a macro with arguments is the "menu" default macro, see the next
section.

Any macro encountered will be replaced by it's value. If that contains
macros too, those will also be replaced. There is a slight danger of
creating looping macros but those should be detected by the clcms.

There are a number of builtin macros in clcms. These can be overridden by specifying your own macro with the same name.

   * *menu*
     (1 integer argument)
     Will be replaced with the main menu, with the argument as is depth
     (depth as in how many subdirectories it will check for subitems). The
     menuitemX macros below are then used for each level of menu.

   * *submenu*
     Will be replaced with the submenu, the list of page items within one page.

   * *title*
     Will be replaced by the title of the current page.

   * *stylesheet*
     Will be replaced by the text 'default.css'.

   * *date*
     Will be replaced by the date (YYYY-mm-dd) when clcms is run.

   * *datefile*
     Will be replaced by the last modified date (YYYY-mm-dd) of the most
     recent one of the .page files.

   * *itemseparator*
     Will be placed between page items. By default it's a small horizontal
     line.

   * *submenuitemseparator*
     Will be placed between submenu items. By default it's a small horizontal
     line.

   * *header*
     Will be used in at the start of every page. Redefine this with you own header.inc

   * *footer*
     Will be used in at the end of every page. Redefine this with you own footer.inc

   * *menustart*
     Will be used at the start of the "menu" macro.

   * *menuend*
     Will be used at the end of the "menu" macro.

   * *menuitem1start*
     Will be used at the start of a menu item in the top level.

     This can be overridden in 2 ways: for a simple .inc, you can override
     it by defining the macro menuitem1start, which will be evaluated, and
     followed by the name of the page (in a link if appropriate). Or you can
     override menuitem1start-arg, which takes the name of the page as it's
     first (and only!) argument. See examples/site2 for an example of this.

   * *menuitem1end*
     Will be used at the end of a menu item in the top level.

   * *menuitem2start*
     Will be used at the start of a menu item in the 2nd level.
     See menuitem1start for more information.

   * *menuitem2end*
     Will be used at the end of a menu item in the 2nd level.

   * *menuitem3start*
     Will be used at the start of a menu item in the 3rd level.
     See menuitem1start for more information.

   * *menuitem3end*
     Will be used at the end of a menu item in the 3rd level.

   * *menuitem4start*
     Will be used at the start of a menu item in the 4th level.
     See menuitem1start for more information.

   * *menuitem4end*
     Will be used at the end of a menu item in the 4th level.

   * *menuitem5start*
     Will be used at the start of a menu item in the 5th level.
     See menuitem1start for more information.

   * *menuitem5end*
     Will be used at the end of a menu item in the 5th level.

   If you want deeper menus, you must define menuitemXstart/end for each
   extra level.

   * *debug*
     (1 string argument)
     Will print the given string to stdout while creating the page. Does
     nothing else.

   * *dumpmacros*
     Will print the list of all current macros and their sources to stdout.

   * *fake*
     Does nothing.


There are also a few built-in macros that cannot be overridden:

   * *NO_WIKI*
     Will cause the next lines
     .not.
     to be passed through the wiki engine

   * *NO_WIKI_END*
     Marks the end of the NO_WIKI part.

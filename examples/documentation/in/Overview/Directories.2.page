By default, clcms will read the directory in/ for the content tree, and
store the results in the directory out/. This can be overridden with a
.setup file in the directory you run it from, see
[[:file_types][]] for more on this.

A typical directory tree would look a little like this small example:

* in/
** my_site.setup
** header.inc
** footer.inc
** fancy.macro
** Welcome/
*** welcome.page
** News/
*** page.meta
*** new\ site.page
*** going\ to\ move.page
*** added\ pages.page
** Contact/
*** Address.page
*** Info.page


my_site.setup contains setup directives for this website, for instance the
name of the CSS style sheet.

header.inc and footer.inc contain HTML that will be included in the pages
that are created.

fancy.macro contains Python code that can be called by using the macro
_fancy_ in a page content item.

The directories Welcome, News, and Contact each stand for a separate page on
the website.

The page.meta file contains some information about the News page.

The files ending in .page contain Wiki-style content for the pages the are
in.

The last part is telling the world of your great new site, so let's add an entry to the News page.

__cd News

__$EDITOR newpage.page

And put in some nice lines about you having this great new site (links and
references to clcms are appreciated ;) ).

Again, we don't specify a fixed sort order, so newer files will end up
before older ones.

In this page, let's say that we do not want to have all .page parts preceded
by their file name title, but we do want to have the date automatically
added. For this we create a .setup file in the News.1/ directory:

__$EDITOR news.setup

in which we put the following lines:

_NO_WIKI_
_NO_MACRO_
<pre>
show_submenu = no
show_item_title = no
show_item_title_date = yes
</pre>
_NO_MACRO_END_
_NO_WIKI_END_

This will tell clcms not to place an in-page submenu in this page, and not
add the page item title, but instead use the last modified date of the .page
files.

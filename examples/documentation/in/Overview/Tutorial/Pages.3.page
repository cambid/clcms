Let's say we want to create 3 pages: a news page, an about page, and a Link page.

We also want a standard menu, but no fancy layout for now.

So, let's create the containers for those pages, shall we?

=mkdir News=
=mkdir About=
=mkdir Links=

If we want these pages to appear on the site in a fixed order, we have to
create a page.meta file in each directory, containing the line
=sort order: X=
where X stands for the place the page should get.

Since we have no news yet, let's start with the About page.

Now that we have our first content, let's see if it works.

Go to the base directory, and run
__clcms.py

This should create an out/ dir, with the pages you just created.

Let's see what clcms made of it, and point a webbrowser to file:///<<dir>>/out/

Since we did not put a .page file or index.html in our base directory, we
get the three pages we created in a list. Click on one and see the
index.html there. After you go to that you see the page you actually
created, albeit without any formatting. View the source to see that there
are a few divs: main, content, menu and, if applicable, submenu. To make
something nice of it, you can create a default.css in your in/ directory
that specifies the layout for these divs. Files that are nog recognized are
simply copied to the output directory.

If the standard form is not to your liking, you can always redefine the
header and footer macros, and all other macros. But i advise you to look at
the examples and read the rest of the documentation before you start doing
that.

Have fun!

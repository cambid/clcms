There are a few things that you should be aware of. I hope to be able to fix these in a future version:

   * You can only specify one link and one image referral per line. You can
     specify both (and make an imaged link) but putting for instance 2 links
     on one line will produce undefined output. This should not be a
     problem, just put a newline after the first link.

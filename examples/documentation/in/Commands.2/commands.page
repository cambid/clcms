You can run clcms by simply running the clcms.py script.

It will check in the current directory for a file ending in .setup. If it
does not exist or does not contain a in_dir directive, the input directory
will be in/ in the current one. The default output directory is out/.

These options can be given on the command line:

   * *-c*
     Print default setup file configuration to stdout. This way, you can
     easily create an overriding setup file for a page.

After upgrading my Ubuntu installs to Breezy i decided it was time for
another theme-hunting expedition. My current one is made of several
different parts.  The background is a variant of the gdm-theme
[[http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=25716][Sleek dragon]].  The
icon set is 
[[http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=27765][Dropline NEU]] and
the window borders are
[[http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=26050][Blended]]. I might
just stick with this one for a while. Of course, that's what I always think
:)

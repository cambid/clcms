* '''[0.3-0.4]'''
** Added some debug messages using the dump() function (enable them by
        setting browser.dom.window.dump.enabled to true in your settings)
** No longer alerts with 'locked' or exceptions, instead it ignores the
        locked setting (doesn't seem to matter anyway for reading out folder
        data) and uses dump() for exceptions.
* '''[0.2-0.3]'''
** Changed the possible Thunderbird version to 1.0 - 1.9+ so that it
        also works in 1.5
** Fixed bad backslashes in front of <<<< >>>> and & characters in the messages
* '''[0.1-0.2]'''
     Made the function call non-blocking
* '''[0.0-0.1]'''
     Initial version

After you have installed it, you get an extra icon in your status bar. You
can either click on it, select 'Tag Links' in the context or tools menu, or
press Alt-L, and Linktag will be activated. While it is on, the current page
and all new pages will have their links expanded with a tag that looks like:
[l12]. The number starts with 1 and just counts up at every link. This way,
all links get a unique tag that you can type on your keyboard, thus
expanding the use of firefoxes accessibility.typeaheadfind. The feature can
be turned off again the same way as it is turned on.

If you select preferences in the extensions menu, you can change the pre-
and postfix of the tag (default "[l" and "] "), and turn of the menu items
and statusbar icon. Of course, it also shows in about:config, under
extensions.linktag.

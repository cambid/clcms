* Updates should be possible with a terminal and an editor
* Content is stored in a directory tree
* Adding pages (or items?) should be as easy as creating a new file
     and typing some lines in it.
* For default pages/items no config necessary
* No HTML, XML or anything alike for normal usage (after initial setup, of course)
* All pages have their binary content (images, download files) in
     the directory of the page itself
* All output is static, no generating on the fly

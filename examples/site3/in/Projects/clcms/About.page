clcms (pronounced "clickmas") is my own command line content management
system. It's not a dynamic cms, but a script that takes a source tree and
creates a web site out of it.

The idea came to me when i was using m4 for my website to generate the HTML,
but i did not like the idea that i was still typing HTML in my pages, even
if it was simplified by using macros. I was updating a wiki page somewhere
when it hit me: i wanted a command line system that was able to take wiki
style input for page content. The result is clcms.

Its in beta state at the moment, mostly to try out some different
approaches to various challenges. But i thought i'd share it now, so if
you're interested and might have some ideas on where to go from here, drop
me a line (or a patch).

It's also a way for me to learn Python, so i might in my ignorance produce
some weird constructs here and there. Please let me know, but be gentle :)

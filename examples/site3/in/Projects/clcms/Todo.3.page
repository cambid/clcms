The todo list contains at least the following things. It is not really a
versioned roadmap since this list resides mostly in my head and changes by
the minute.

I have also added some things that aren't on the short-term planning, but
only some wild ideas that haven't taken much shape yet. You can probably
tell them apart from the rest. Of course, ideas and feedback are always
welcome.


The most important things are (in random order):

   * *Error detection and feedback*

     There's still a lot to improve on error handling i guess.

   * *Code cleanup*

     The everlasting todo.

   * *Documentation*

     The other everlasting todo.

   * *Page types*

     I'd like to add some form of page types, i.e. 'blog style' or 'FAQ' or
     something like that.

   * *File modified date*

     The file modified could maybe use some sort of memory, copying them
     without keeping the original modified dates can often lead to an
     unexpected page item order.

   * *Menu recreation*

     Currently, if you add or remove pages, the others are not regenerated,
     resulting in outdated menus for those pages.

   * *Recreation of file check*

     Files are only rewritten if one of the .page, .inc or .macro files used
     are changed. But internally they are still completely built, resulting
     in a serious performace drop.

   * *Frontend*

     No idea how or what, but maybe a nice command-line frontend that shows
     the current page tree to select and edit files.

   * *RSS*

     Let the generator create an RSS feed from specified pages.

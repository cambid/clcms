This extension for [[http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/][Mozilla Thunderbird]] 
allows you to specify, for each
seperate mail folder, a system command that will be executed when new mail
is found there. This way, you specify different actions for less important
folders, or no action at all. For more information, see the 
[[:mailboxalert][Mailbox Alert page]].

Current todo list includes:

   * *Screenshots*
     While there are not many things to show, every page need screenshots :p
   * *Multiple tabs*
     Currently, the 'enabled' status is global, but link tagging is actually handled per tab. It doesn't break if you turn it on in one and then off in another, but i should make the state on a per-tab basis or something.

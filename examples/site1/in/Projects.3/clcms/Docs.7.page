The documentation is a sort of web site created by clcms itself. It is in
the distribution under the directory examples/documentation/ and can be
created by entering that directory and running clcms.py.

An online version can be found [[Documentation/index.html][Here]].

Please don't mind the layout. That stuff isn't really my cup of tea :p

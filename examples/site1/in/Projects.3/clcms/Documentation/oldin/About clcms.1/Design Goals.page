   * Content is stored in a directory tree
   * Adding pages (or items?) should be as easy as creating a new file
     and typing some lines in it.
   * For default pages/items no config necessary
   * No HTML or anything alike for normal usage
   * All pages have their binary content (images, download files) in
     the directory of the page itself
   * All output is static, no generating on the fly

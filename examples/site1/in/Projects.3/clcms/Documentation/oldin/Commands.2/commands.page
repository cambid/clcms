You can run clcms by simply running the clcms.py script.

It will check in the current directory for a file ending in .setup. If it
does not exist or does not contain a in_dir directive, the input directory
will be the directory called "in/" in the current directory. The default
output directory is "out/".

These options can be given on the command line:

   * *-c*
     or
     *--write-config*
     
     Print setup file configuration to stdout. This way, you can
     easily create an overriding setup file for a page.

     clcms will quit after printing and will not generate output.
   * *-m*
     or
     *--no-macros*
     
     Do not put the output through the macro engine

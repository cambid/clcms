You can create your own macros by putting .macro files in your root or
content directory. Like .setup files, .macro files you create are only used
in the current directory and those beneath it. Creating a macro file called
"MYMACRO.macro" will give you the macro "_MYMACRO_" in your pages.

The macro will be replaced by the value you give to the string 'output' in
your macro definition.

Example:

You create a file called "MYSITENAME.macro" that looks like this:

=output = "Jabberwocky's Vorpal Blade Site"=

In one of your .page files, you put the line:

=Welcome to _MYSITENAME_!=

This line will end up on your page as:

Welcome to Jabberwocky's Vorpal Blade Site!

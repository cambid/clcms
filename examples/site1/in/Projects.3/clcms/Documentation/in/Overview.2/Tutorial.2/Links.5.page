Create some nice links in one or more .page files here, you can create a
link by using
[[
<URL>
][
<name>
]]

Note that any line in your .page file can only contain 1 link, and a
link must be on a complete line without line breaks.

If you want to specify an external link, you can just use http:// in the url.

If you want to link to something of this site, you can use the path relative
to the current page directory. Note that in that case, you should replace
spaces in names with '_', and the output file name will only consist of the
part up to the first '.' in the input file name. So if you link to an
internal page of which the source directory is called "Important Page.3" you
should link to it as "Important_Page". If you want to test locally, it is
wise to add /index.html to the URL.

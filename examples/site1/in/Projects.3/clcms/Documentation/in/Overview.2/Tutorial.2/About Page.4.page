First go to the about page.

=cd About.2/=

Let's say that the order of the contents of this page does not matter for
us. We'll specify no sort order, and clcms will order them by last modified
date.


Page content must be put in so-called .page files, you do not have to type
html tags, just type some lines. You can do 'special' things by using Wiki
style syntax See 
[[../../Content_Tree/Wiki_Parser/index.html][Wiki Parser]] for more 
information on this.

 so let's create one:

=$EDITOR About\ Me.page=

Just write some nice lines about what you do, or not.

=$EDITOR About\ this\ site.page=

This is
.the.
place to put those praises you have for the system you have created your
beautifule site with (for the record, that's clcms).

Note that after building the site, the file names up to the dot can be
formed into a small in-page submenu, if there is more than one .page file
present.

Okay for now, we are done here, you can also add other nice stuff about you
or your site, but I'll leave that up to you.

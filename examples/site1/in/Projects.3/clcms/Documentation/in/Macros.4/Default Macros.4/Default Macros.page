There are a number of builtin macros in clcms. These can be overridden by specifying your own macro with the same name.

   * *MENU*
     (1 integer argument)
     Will be replaced with the main menu, with the argument as is depth
     (depth as in how many subdirectories it will check for subitems). The
     menuitemX macros below are then used for each level of menu.

   * *SUBMENU*
     Will be replaced with the submenu, the list of page items within one page.

   * *TITLE*
     Will be replaced by the title of the current page.

     Will be replaced by the last modified date (YYYY-mm-dd) of the most
     recent one of the .page files.

   * *ITEM-SEPARATOR*
     Will be placed between page items. By default it's a small horizontal

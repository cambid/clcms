clcms makes a distinction between files based on two things: whether they
are a file or a directory, and what their extension is. The default
extension separator is the ., but this can be changed. 

There are 4 different file types:

   * *.setup file*
     A file that ends in .setup contains configuration directives for clcms to use. These directives will override the current ones, or be added to them. They will
     *only*
     be used in the current directory and the subdirectories of the current directory.

   * *.setup directory*	
     A Directory whose name does not end in .setup will be scanned for
     .setup, .inc and .macro files. These will be read and counted as if
     they stood in the current directory.

   * *Normal directory*	
     A Directory whose name does not end in .setup will be seen as a page
     container. It either stands for a website page itself (if it has one or
     more .page files), it contains several other pages (if it has page
     directories as children), or both.

   * *.page file*
     A .page file contains the actual content of a (part of a) page. As the
     directory stands for the page itself, this stands for the content.

   * *.inc file*
     A .inc file will be read and added directly to the macro list. For this
     directory and its subdirectories, you can use _<filename>_ (where
     filename is the .inc file name up to the first (!) '.' character. This
     will be replaced by the contents of the .inc file.

   * *.macro file*
     .macro files work the same way, except that they do not contain plain
     text, but actual Python code. See the section
     [[Macros/index.html][Macros]] for more on this.

   * All other files are seen as content data and are directly copied to the
     output directory of the current page.

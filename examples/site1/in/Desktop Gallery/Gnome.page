This was the desktop I used during my last year at University. Gnome has a boatload of features, most of which are very nice, and a decent default layout. Just like KDE though, it's not very nice to your processor and memory, and therefore runs much too slow for my taste. Still, if your computer is fast enough, I can heartily recommend Gnome.

clcms
=====
Welcome to clcms, the command line content management system. Only files, no
databas. Only python without special libraries.

For now, i'll use a code first, try later type of setup, so
the internals and names are almost certainly subject to a lot of change.

All current documentation resides in the examples/documentation dir which is
also an example of a very small site for clcms.

The setup is based on my simple site and the site of Jelte Jansen: every page
has a few items: menu, submenu and content

I'm using this project to expand my knowledge of python and learn the usage of
git and github.So things might be done a little awkwardly, don't hesitate to
let me know if things could be done in a better way :)

You can create the documentation by going to the example/documentation dir
and running
<thisdir>/bin/clcms.py

After that, point your browser to examples/documentation/out/index.html

If you want to include the word "_<macro>_" in your site, use __<macro>__.

See http://old.tjeb.nl/Projects/clcms/index.html for more info and an online
version of the documentation directory

Welcome to clcms, the command line content management system

For now, i'll use a code first, try later type of setup, so
the internals and names are almost certainly subject to a lot of change.

All current documentation resides in the examples/documentation dir which is
also an example of a very small site for clcms.

The setup is based on my simple site: every page has a few items: menu,
submenu and content

Ow and i'm using this to learn Python too, so things might be done a little
awkwardly, don't hesitate to let me know if things could be done in a better
way :)

You can create the documentation by going to the example/documentation dir
and running
<thisdir>/bin/clcms.py 

After that, point your browser to examples/documentation/out/index.html

If you want to include the word "_<macro>_" in your site, use __<macro>__.

See http://jelte.nlnetlabs.nl/Projects/clcms/index.html for more info and 
an online version of the documentation directory

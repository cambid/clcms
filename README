Welcome to clcms, the command line content management system

For now, i'll use a code first, try later type of setup, so
the internals and names are almost certainly subject to a lot of change.

See DESIGN for a quick brainstorm of my initial thoughts 

The setup is based on my simple site: every page has a few items: menu,
submenu and content


Ow and i'm using this to learn Python too, so things might be done a little
awkwardly, don't hesitate to let me know if things could be done in a better
way :)

See the example dir for an example of a site (based on my own, found at
http://jelte.nlnetlabs.nl).

You can create the site by going to the example dir and running 
<thisdir>/bin/clcms.py 



Macro's:

_MENU_ : include the menu
_DATE_ : include the date (when running clcms.py)
_DATE_FILE_ : include the date of the file

If you want to include the word "_<macro>_" in your site, use __<macro>__.

TODO:
- Wiki engine, add html to wiki style files
- read .setup files
- Macro engine, implement all html thingamabobs as (internal?) macro's
- error handling (:p)

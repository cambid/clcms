Welcome to clcms, the command line content management system

For now, i'll use a code first, try later type of setup, so
the internals and names are almost certainly subject to a lot of change.

See DESIGN for a quick brainstorm of my initial thoughts 

The setup is based on my simple site: every page has a few items: menu,
submenu and content


Ow and i'm using this to learn Python too, so things might be done a little
awkwardly, don't hesitate to let me know if things could be done in a better
way :)

See the example dir for an example of a site (based on my own, found at
http://jelte.nlnetlabs.nl).

You can create the site by going to the example dir and running 
<thisdir>/bin/clcms.py 



Macro's:

_MENU_ : include the menu
_DATE_ : include the date (when running clcms.py)
_DATE_FILE_ : include the date of the file

If you want to include the word "_<macro>_" in your site, use __<macro>__.

TODO:
- Wiki engine, add html to wiki style files
- read .setup files
- Macro engine, implement all html thingamabobs as (internal?) macro's
- error handling (:p)

Formatting help:

    * bold put word/phrase in asterisks: *your phrase*
    * bullet list 3 spaces, asterisk, 1 space:    * your text
    * headings 3 dashes, 1 to 6 pluses, 1 space: ---++ Your Heading
    * italic put word/phrase in underscores: _your words_
    * links use topic name or URL: WebHome, http://yahoo.com, or
[[http://yahoo.com/][link to Yahoo]]
    * monospaced put word/phrase in equal signs: =your words=
    * paragraphs separate with blank line

images can be included like this:
{{<url>}{alt_tag}}

only 1 link or image can be used per line atm


algo:
	read setup files (default *.setup)
	read page files (default *.page)
	if one or more page files:
		create page, copy
	for every subdir:
		repeat
	copy every other file to out/cur/

Requirements:
	- Fully controlled from the command line
	- Adding pages (or items?) should be as easy as creating a new file
	  and typing some lines in it.
	- for default pages/items no config necessary
	

Concept:
	rootdir/<menu_dir>/page[/items]
	page syntax in wiki style
	.meta (?) file to override defaults
	filename is page name, itemname is submenu name
	some *simple* macro's
		- %DATE% replace with date of writing (or maybe file date?)
	default css style names: content, menu, item, etc.

Open issues:
	1) better way to do links? and images?
	2) locking?
	3) what to do with changing filenames?
	4) menu as separate include/macro?

Possible enhancements:
	- web interface?
